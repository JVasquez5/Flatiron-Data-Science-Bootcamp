# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to analyze data regarding the movie industry and determine whether or not Microsoft should create movies. I would like to thank Microsoft for providing the zip file containing various csv's full of information regarding the movie industry. However, while I appreciate said information, the files were not up-to-date. Thus, in order to provide the best and most relevant business intelligence I decided to get the information straight from the source: Box Office Mojo, by IMDbPro, and The Movie Database. 

The Box Office Mojo(BOM) website was extremely user-friendly and provided exactly the right pieces of information in order to provide actionable insight regarding entrance into the movie business. In order to web scrap I utilized Request and Beautiful Soup. As with the BOM website, The Movie Database(TMDB) website was easy to navigate and quick to sign up and create a developer account to garner an API key.

For both the analysis and visualizations I utilized Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Seaborn.

Once I complied and reviewed 1000 movies I was able to uncover treads dicating what movies Microsoft should be making. 



## Objectives

The following questions were answered through my analysis:

* Who is the competition?
* What is the current size of the market?
* Where is the market headed?
* Which genres return the greatest ROI?
* Is there a correlation between budget and worldwide lifetime gross?

## Actionable Insight

* Microsoft should enter the movie studio business.
    * The market trajectory is growing and with movie theaters opening up soon, the customer base will look to seek entertainment.
* Action, Action, and more Action.
    * The number one priority should be to make action movies as it is the most profitable genre.
* Focus on a global audience.
    * Movies that focus on a global audience obtain a greater overall net revenue.


## Recommendations

* Utilize proprietary technologies and resources to create movies.
    * Although action movies are the most profitable and typically require CGI nowadays, among the top 5 profitable genres are animation movies. 
* Focus on making films with mass global appeal.
    * There is a strong correlation between films that generate large net revenue if and when they generate large worldwide lifetime gross.
* Manufacture a win from a slowed down market.
    * Now is the time to develop movies as the customer base is vigorously awaiting the return of movies on the big screen. 
* Adapt/create a cinematic franchise, or at the very least create movies with sequels/prequels.
    * Ideally buying out, but could also enter a licensing agreement to adapt an obscure, yet has a cult-like following, comic-book/video game series.


# Future work

* Compare the net revenue of films that belong to collections versus those that donâ€™t.
* More statistical analysis to derive a clearer picture of the movie industry.
    * Incorporating other variables I already obtained like popularity and the length of movies. 
* Pulled more data.
    * Retrieval of additional information about movies: the names of actors, producers, directors etc., the period in which the movie was released (season, holiday, etc). 
* Cross-reference the movie data to streaming service data.
    * Have the trends moved now that we are in the rise of the digital streaming age with organizations like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.
